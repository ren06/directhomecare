                <h4>Helping people maintain their independence</h4>
                <p>The elderly and disabled often require additional care, especially if they are already incapacitated by disease. A specialised centre can certainly provide this level of care; however, the financial costs of such care can be high. Specialised centres also deprive the person of his/her home environment, contact with neighbours and friends, and enjoyment of daily activities.</p>

                <h4>Care in home maintains the person's sense of dignity</h4>
                <p>As opposed to institutionalised care, providing care in home helps maintain the person's sense of dignity, independence and sense of normalcy. Care in home is also more humane and personalised, allowing the elderly or disabled person to live his or her life in much the same manner that he or she has always been accustomed to. Finally, care in home is much less expensive than the care provided in a specialised centre.</p>

                <h4>Difficulty to provide adequate care</h4>
                <p>Unfortunately, concerned neighbours and friends cannot always provide the level of care in home that an elderly or disabled person might require. Even the adult children of such individuals will inevitably find it difficult to provide adequate care in home and attend to their work and/or parental responsibilities. The difficulty of this situation is compounded if the elderly or disabled person also suffers from Alzheimer's disease or other debilitating illness, making 24/7 care a necessity.</p>

                <h4>Agencies are expensive</h4>
                <p>Because of the recent push for home care for the elderly and disabled, many agencies have appeared to fill this need. However, due to the administrative fees of such agencies as well as their focus on maintaining a high profit margin, many individuals cannot afford to hire home carers. Alternately, independent carers are available for hire but may not be reliable or trustworthy.</p>

                    <p>To help people solve the issue of providing adequate care in home for their loved ones, Direct Homecare offers qualified carers who are not only reliable but affordable. The reason why Direct Homecare carers are not as expensive as agency carers is because there are no intermediaries to pay. This lowers the costs involved in home care. Direct Homecare carers still perform all the functions of agency carers including domestic tasks and personal care. They also provide much needed companionship and support for the individuals they serve.</p>
