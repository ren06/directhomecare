                <p>If you have to choose between care home and nursing home, go for care home. Receiving care at home is better than staying in specialised centres because it is more personalised. It is offers individualised care designed to meet the needs of the patient and family</p>

                    <h4>Company and conversation</h4>
                    <p>People with disabilities crave for company and conversation. They want more interaction with friends and family, which is what home care can provide them. It allows maximum freedom for the patient and encourages independence.</p>
                    <p>Home care or care home is more affordable than specialised centre. An assisted living facility or nursing home is very expensive and can drain a patient's pocketbook within a short time. Getting home care through an agency costs a lot because the agency factors in their high profits and high administrative fees. Additionally, contracting with an independent carer might not be a good idea due to reliability issues.</p>
                    <p>But with Direct Homecare you can rest assured that you will get reliable and affordable service because there is no intermediary. So care home or receiving care at home offers many benefits and is more cost-effective than staying in a specialised nursing home.</p>
