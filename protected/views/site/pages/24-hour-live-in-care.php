                <h4>The ideal solution</h4>
                <p>When the health of a loved one starts to fail, families face difficult decisions regarding the constant care that needs to be provided for those with persistent medical concerns. Families looking for a health care provider for their loved ones often consider sending them to a specialised centre. However, specialised centres are expensive and group many patients with different needs together. The ideal solution to a specialised centre is 24 hour live-in care.</p>

                <h4>Allowing the patient to remain at home</h4>
                <p>Opting for 24 hour live-in care gives the benefits of a specialised centre while allowing the patient to remain at home. A carer is trained to provide the assistance that elderly or disabled patients need with completing household tasks and making sure that personal care is kept up. The personalised aspect of 24 hour live-in care means that the patient receives exceptional, individual service instead of being one of many residents in a specialised centre.</p>

                <h4>Receive more attention</h4>
                <p>Even though home care is provided on an individual basis and allows the patient to receive more attention than in a centre setting, 24 hour live-in care is less expensive than using a specialised centre. This is because the care is provided in the patient's own home, so there is no expense for the living quarters.</p>

                <h4>Choosing an independent carer</h4>
                <p>Unfortunately, many families choose to find home care providers through an expensive agency. These agencies pass the costs of administrative fees on to clients. Families hoping to save money often choose an independent carer, but it should be noted that independent carers may not have the experience needed to provide comprehensive, reliable care in the comfort of an individual's own home.</p>
