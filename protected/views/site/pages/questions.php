                                Yes, in fact paying online is the only way to pay with Direct Homecare. It's easier, you do not need to keep track of the hours worked nor to worry about having the cash ready.<br>
                                It's also safer, not having to handle cash.

                                The price is £10.95 per hour or £99.95 per day for Live-in Care. There is no extra hidden costs, other than supplies or food which you ask the carer to buy for you.

                                Direct Homecare does not provide insurance. A specialised insurance policy costs around £70.00 per year. In the unlikely event that your property is damaged due to your carer or where an insurance claim is deemed necessary, the following steps should be followed:<br>
                                All our carers are self-employed and therefore they may have their own insurance already. Please note we do not track if our carers have insurance.

                                Of course not. However, we recommend that you are always present for the first meeting to show the carer the home and give them instructions.

                                No, they don't bring cleaning products or food at the service users' homes. However they can help buying these as long as you pay for the products.
