                <h4>Providing care at home</h4>
                <p>Disabled home care is the assistance offered to a person with disabilities who may encounter difficulty performing daily tasks like using the bathroom, cleaning, preparing meals or taking medications. The goal of providing care at home is to keep the disabled person in a familiar environment rather than keeping the person in a nursing facility. It encourages independence by allowing people with disabilities to live on their own with assistance.</p>

                <h4>Providing continuous care assistance</h4>
                <p>The types of services provided in a disabled home care vary depending on the level of assistance required. Depending on the nature of the disability, disabled home care can be provided by an trained care-giver. A qualified carer is needed for monitoring health conditions and administering injections. Sometimes a live-in carer is required to provide continuous disabled home care assistance.</p>

                <h4>Providing disabled persons with assistance</h4>
                <p>Care-givers providing disabled persons with assistance may be required to perform tasks like cleaning, cooking, and doing errands. This type of care does not require special skills or training. People with disabilities may need help with tasks like bathing, dressing, getting in and out of bed, grooming, using the bathroom, feeding and exercise. These require a certified nursing aide or personal assistant.</p>

                <h4>Home care is better than care in specialised centres</h4>
                <p>If you're given a choice between disabled home care and nursing facility, opt for the first. Home care is better than care in specialised centres because it is more personalised. Providing care on a more personal level can benefit the elderly and people with disabilities by giving them hope and happiness. People in this condition strive for company and conversation, and this is what disabled home care can provide them. Home care allows them to have more interaction with neighbours, family and friends. The quality of life offered by home care is far beyond what it could be in an assisted living centre or nursing home.</p>

                    <h4>Reliable and affordable</h4>
                    <p>Home care is less expensive than specialised centre. Nursing facilities can drain a person's bank account in a short time. Home care through an agency might be expensive because of the agency's high administrative fees and high profits. Additionally, home care with an independent carer might not be reliable. Home care with Direct Homecare is reliable and affordable because there is no intermediary.</p>
