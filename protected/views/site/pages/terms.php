                <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    Direct Homecare is an Internet based service introducing Carers to Clients. Clients can hire a Carer for themselves or a relative.
                    Direct Homecare is not an agency or a home care agency. It is not regulated by the Care Quality Commission and it is not a medical organisation.
                    Rather, Direct Homecare is a small ads service with improved functions facilitating the Client/Carer relationship. However Direct Homecare remains completely out of the scope of managing, being liable or responsible for any personal care relationships.
                    The Carers are self-employed workers and provide their services in total independence as independent self-employed carers as defined by the Care Quality Commission.

                <h4>2. Definitions of parties</h4>
                <p>
                    <b>Carer:</b> a person providing care services to a Service User.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Service User:</b> a person receiving care services from a Carer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Client:</b> a person making the decision to purchase a care service. The Client can be the Service User or not. The Client is capable, with regard to his/her mental and physical conditions, to understand and manage the relationship with the Carer.<br />NOTE: a Service User and the Client cannot be the same person if this person is not capable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>DH:</b> Direct Homecare Ltd is a limited company introducing Carers to Clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These four parties have obligations to each other; there are five relationships which are explained in section IV.
                    It is important to note that DH has no contractual relationships and no obligations nor responsibilities towards the Service User. If the Service User is the same person as the Client, then DH has a relationship with that person as a Client but not as a Service User.

                <h5>5.1 Cancellation</h5>
                <p>
                    Before the service takes place, the client can cancel the service through the menu "Cancel" in "My bookings". The cost of the service cancelled will be refunded in the form of a credit voucher to the client's DH balance, which may be used for any following purchases without time limit.<br />
                    If no carer has been assigned to the service yet, the client will receive a 100 % voucher refund.<br />
                    If a carer has already been assigned, DH will pay a compensation fee to the carer for potential lost work.<br />
                    For cancellations more than 7 days before the start of a service, the client will incur a 10% penalty fee, and the carer will receive a 10% compensation.<br />
                    For cancellations less than 7 days before the start of a service, the client will incur a 25% penalty fee, and the carer will receive a 25% compensation.
                </p>
                <h5>5.2 Complaint and non delivery of service</h5>
                <p>
                    Once the service has started, the client can complain about non-delivery of the service up until 7 days after the end of the service.<br />
                    If a complaint is raised, then DH will work at resolving the issue between the carer and the client.<br />
                    Any time not worked by the carer (counted by the minute at the rate paid by the client) will be refunded to the client's card.
                </p>
                <h5>5.3 Impossibility of finding a suitable carer</h5>
                <p>
                    On certain occasions, it may happen that DH can not find a suitable carer for the service.<br />
                    In this case, DH will give the client a card refund for the service not delivered.<br />
                    The client does not need to raise a complaint in this instance as it will be dealt automatically by DH.
                </p>
                <h5>5.4 Cancellation of future payments</h5>
                <p>
                    As stated in the introduction, the client can make a booking for any period of time (i.e. several months).
                    DH will only invoice for the first 2 weeks at the time of booking. Then the client will be subsequently invoiced every 2 weeks for the duration of the booking.<br />
                    The date of the future payments and their amount is stated in "My bookings".<br />
                    The client can cancel these future payments at any time (before they are charged) by simply changing the end date of the booking in "My bookings".<br />
                    There is absolutely no engagement and no restriction or penalties to cancel future payments. The client is completely free to do so.
