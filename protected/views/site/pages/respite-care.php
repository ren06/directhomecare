                <h4>The benefits of respite care</h4>
                <p>As they age, many individuals need extra assistance from medical providers or family members in order to complete daily tasks. Individuals who are truly fortunate receive specialised care from a family member who is willing to stay at home and assist with grooming, basic medical tasks and housekeeping. Other individuals rely on the services of a home care provider. Direct Homecare provide reliable, affordable care-giving services to the elderly and disabled.</p>

                <h4>What is respite care ?</h4>
                <p>The types of services provided in a disabled home care vary depending on the level of assistance required. Depending on the nature of the disability, disabled home care can be provided by an trained care-giver. A qualified carer is needed for monitoring health conditions and administering injections. Sometimes a live-in carer is required to provide continuous disabled home care assistance.</p>

                <h4>Providing disabled persons with assistance</h4>
                <p>A type of home care, respite care refers to a care-giver who temporarily takes over care duties in order to give a regular care-giver a <b>break or holiday from his or her duties</b>. Such services are generally used by family members who care for an elderly or disabled parent in their own homes. Carers who work in respite care specialise in temporarily working in-home with disabled or elderly individuals. They provide all the services of the full-time carer while he or she is away.</p>

                <h4>Is respite care right for your situation?</h4>
                <p>Caring for a loved one can be very rewarding. Unfortunately, it can also be quite exhausting. If you act as a care-giver for an elderly or disabled family member, you know how challenging your position can be. Perhaps you need to take a brief holiday in order to recharge and rejuvenate. In such situations, a respite care service can provide the care your loved one needs while you are away.</p>

                    <h4>Reliable and affordable</h4>
                    <p>Home care is less expensive than specialised centre. Nursing facilities can drain a person's bank account in a short time. Home care through an agency might be expensive because of the agency's high administrative fees and high profits. Additionally, home care with an independent carer might not be reliable. Home care with Direct Homecare is reliable and affordable because there is no intermediary.</p>
                    <p>In general, it makes sense to work with a home care service when choosing a respite care provider. Pursuing the help of a home care service is generally less expensive than sending a loved one to a specialised care centre. Direct Homecare works to ensure that temporary care-givers show up on time and faithfully perform their duties while you are away.</p>
                    <p>Home care services can send qualified care-givers to handle respite care duties. These individuals are trained in providing assistance to the elderly and disabled. Care-givers generally enjoy working with their patients. Both families and care-givers benefit from the services of Direct Homecare. </p>
