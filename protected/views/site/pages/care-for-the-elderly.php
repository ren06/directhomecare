                <h4>Families have changed</h4>
                <p>It has been said that today's seniors crave their independence more than any previous generation. It was not long ago that the family norm consisted of families living in a single dwelling for the entirety of their lives. While this has changed only recently (relatively speaking), the change has been dramatic. And with these changes, the need to care for the elderly has given rise to two divergent systems: home care and specialised centres. With growing concerns about quality control, scandal, and that desire for independence, home care has begun to seem like the better choice in many circumstances.</p>

                <h4>Home care for the elderly</h4>
                <p>Home care for the elderly offers a number of advantages over a move to specialised housing. The patient is able to stay in a familiar environment, unencumbered by a move to strange surroundings. Studies have shown this alone can make a tremendous difference when it comes to establishing routine, maintaining self confidence, and personalising care for the elderly. Many experts believe these factors play a substantial role in maintaining wellness and keeping dementia at bay.</p>

                <h4>More affordable than care homes</h4>
                <p>If costs are an issue, home care for the elderly is almost always more affordable than a specialised centre. At a time when the economic environment has put pressure on families who need to provide for both children and pensioners, this can be among the considerations that matter most. When you consider that the quality of Direct Homecare often meets or exceeds that found in a centre, it makes the choice that much more obvious. With home care for the elderly, you are paying a salary. With a specialised centre, you are paying for administrative overhead, not to mention substantial built-in profits.</p>

                <h4>The hiring process also gives the customer more control</h4>
                <p>Many seniors and their adult children have found increased reliability in choosing Direct Homecare for the elderly as opposed to entrusting their relatives to an independent care centre. The hiring process also gives the customer more control when choosing the personnel who will be caring for their loved senior. Finally, it gives the family an opportunity to keep a close eye on their loved one's health, an option that is often lost with larger services in the business of care for the elderly.</p>
