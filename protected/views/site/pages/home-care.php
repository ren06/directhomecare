                <h4>Why choose home care over other options ?</h4>
                <p>For those who require the assistance of a care-giver, there are several options available. In terms of service and cost, home care stands out among the field. When compared to the experience provided by specialised centres and independent care agencies, this type of service is able to provide a superior level of care at a more affordable cost.</p>

            <div id="2" class="large-10 columns">
                <h4>Greater quality of care</h4>
                <p>Home care is able to provide elderly and disabled people with a greater quality of care than what is offered through specialised care centres. Aside from receiving in-depth attention from individual care providers, the care received is more enriching. Those who require assistance can receive the care they need in a familiar home environment.</p>
                <p>Transferring an elderly or disabled person to an assisted living facility is a potentially traumatic experience. It can cause a person to lose self-confidence, and it can also disrupt a person's comforting routines and habits. Alternatively, the personalised assistance provided by home care is able to foster a more pleasing and comfortable living situation. Users of this type of service can maintain many aspects of their normal life.</p>

                <h4>Comparison of costs</h4>
                <p>The cost of entering a specialised centre is high when compared to using a home care service. These centres often have high overhead costs and administrative expenditures due to the nature of care that they provide. Since home care services take place in the user's home, service providers do not need to pass on the cost of operating an entire facility to its users.</p>

                <h4>Reliable and affordable option for care</h4>
                <p>When compared to other options, home care offers exceptional quality to those who need personal care and assistance with routine domestic tasks at a more affordable cost than less desirable options. Additionally, by maintaining a more personal working relationship with a Direct Homecare provider, the users of this type of service can more comfortably rely on it. Instead of working with potentially numerous intermediaries, users can rely on warm, personal relationships with their care providers.</p>
