                <h4>Warmth and security</h4>
                <p>Home is a word most people associate with family, warmth and a sense of security found nowhere else. It is no surprise, then, that many older adults and disabled individuals prefer to receive 24 hour care in their own homes rather than opting to relocate to a specialised nursing centre. Many people have years of history and treasured memories in their family home but need a little extra help with housework and mobility issues. Home care-givers make it possible for these people to stay in their own homes by providing personal assistance with daily activities and upkeep.</p>

                <h4>Advantages of home care</h4>
                <p>The benefits of 24 hour care in the home are significant. Change can be a significant source of stress and can even cause health problems in vulnerable individuals. By minimising the degree of change that older adults must undergo, home care-givers provide a stable and less stressful environment for individuals who may be in delicate health. Familiar surroundings, friendly neighbours and usual activities can ensure a greater degree of psychological comfort as well. Elderly and disabled individuals who retain these valued contacts and daily routines often enjoy better health than those who undergo major changes in living conditions. Home care services range from scheduled visits throughout the week to full-time 24 hour care. Additionally, home care is significantly less expensive than comparable specialised nursing care facilities in the same area.</p>

                <h4>Finding the right home carer arrangement</h4>
                <p>The right care-giver can make a positive difference in the lives of elderly or disabled individuals. In most cases, Direct Homecare providers are less expensive and more reliable than other 24 hour care arrangements. Agencies typically cost significantly more due to their higher overhead and consequent increased operating costs; these for-profit organisations are concerned with turning a profit and usually charge what the market will bear. Independent care-givers may charge less for 24 hour care; however, these individuals may be less reliable and less skilled than others in the care giving field.</p>
