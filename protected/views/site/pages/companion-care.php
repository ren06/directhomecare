                <h4>Maintaining their independence</h4>
                <p>Most individuals who are elderly or disabled yearn for the option of maintaining their independence by remaining in their own homes. The alternative of moving in with a family member carries a burdensome connotation in their minds. Relocating into a specialised care centre threatens their sense of functionality and dignity. Companion care is an option that will leave the client feeling more confident and in control, and leave you feeling relieved knowing that your loved one is receiving one-on-one personal care and the warmth of companionship.</p>

                <h4>Personal care and household duties</h4>
                <p>Companion care is defined as a primary care-giver whose responsibility is to assist their charge with personal care and household duties. Such a care-giver will aid in personal grooming, basic health care, housekeeping, shopping, meal preparation and other tasks with which the client may request assistance. The care-giver also provides companionship that every human being craves. Some care-givers take up residence in the client’s home, while others offer services on an hourly basis. The client is able to retain their routine, their home environment, their sense of belonging in their neighbourhood and their regular contact with family and friends.</p>

                <h4>A care centre is expensive</h4>
                <p>The primary goal of a specialise care centre is to administer the most basic care to a high volume of residents. This care is typically provided by a very limited staff that is overwhelmed due to budgetary constraints. Attention given to any one resident is minimal, impersonal and, at times, demoralising. A resident whose mental faculties are unaffected, yet he or she resides in such a facility due to physical limitations, can ultimately suffer from social withdrawal and lack of confidence. All day-to-day activities and housing rules are planned and dictated to the residents with only staff convenience in mind. The individual no longer has the freedom to make choices. Care within a specialised care centre is expensive in order to cover costs of housing, feeding, care, social activities, staffing and overhead fees.</p>

                <h4>Home companion care is a more personal</h4>
                <p>Home companion care is a more personal and less expensive approach to caring for the elderly or disabled, particularly when choosing a care-giver through a Direct Homecare program. While it may seem simple enough to hire an individual care-giver who works independently, concerns regarding his or her dependability can surface. Conversely, hiring a care-giver through a home care agency is less cost effective due to the agency’s administrative fees and profits in order to run their business and maintain a sizeable staff for hire. Companion care through Direct Homecare, which operates without intermediaries, will yield the most dependable and affordable alternative.</p>

                    <h4>Opportunity for spending quality time</h4>
                    <p>Companion care offers such benefits to the client’s family members as peace of mind, a line of communication regarding their loved one’s status and the opportunity for spending quality time with the person that would have otherwise been spent administering care or travelling to a care centre during designated visiting hours. The client benefits from warm and enriched companionship, daily care and the ability to continue enjoying life in his or her own familiar home.</p>
