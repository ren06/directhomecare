                <h4>Home care is better than care in specialised centres</h4>
                <p>If you're given a choice between disabled home care and nursing facility, opt for the first. Home care is better than care in specialised centres because it is more personalised. Providing care on a more personal level can benefit the elderly and people with disabilities by giving them hope and happiness. People in this condition strive for company and conversation, and this is what disabled home care can provide them. Home care allows them to have more interaction with neighbours, family and friends. The quality of life offered by home care is far beyond what it could be in an assisted living centre or nursing home.</p>

                    <h4>Reliable and affordable</h4>
                    <p>Home care is less expensive than specialised centre. Nursing facilities can drain a person's bank account in a short time. Home care through an agency might be expensive because of the agency's high administrative fees and high profits. Additionally, home care with an independent carer might not be reliable. Home care with Direct Homecare is reliable and affordable because there is no intermediary.</p>
